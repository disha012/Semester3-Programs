Euclid's GCD algorithm
Now any divisor맋맊ommon to맔마nd맕맔ust divide the first term with no remainder, since it is the product of맕마nd an integer. Therefore,맋맔ust also divide the second term since맋맋ivides맔마nd맔말s the sum of the two terms.
Since마ny맋ivisor common to맔마nd맕맔ust divide the remainder of맔/n, we know that, in particular, the gcd does, since it is a common divisor. It just happens to be the greatest such divisor.
So by taking the GCD(n, remainder of맔/n), we can "close in quickly" on the GCD of맔마nd맕. 
Now we can write:
int gcd(int m, int n) {
   if ((m % n) == 0)
      return n;
   else
      return gcd(n, m % n);
}

gcd(468, 24)
gcd(24, 12)
=> 12

OUTPUT:
Enter the two values for which GCD is to be calculated
22
12
The GCD is 2
